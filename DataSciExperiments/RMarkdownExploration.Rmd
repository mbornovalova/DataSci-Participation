```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This loads packages you will need
```{r}
library(psych)
library(gapminder)
library(DT)
library(tibble)
```

This code sequence starts exploring BFI dataset
```{r}
x <- c(1, 5, 4, 9, 0)
mean(x, na.rm = T)
mean(x[x>2], na.rm = T)
data(bfi)
summary(bfi)
mean(bfi$C1, na.rm = T)
```

This code sequence loads MTCars and begins describing them, it has 7 variables
```{r mtcars view, echo=FALSE}
mtcars
summary(mtcars)
mean(mtcars$mpg, na.rm = T)
mtcars["mpg"]
```
```{r}
mtcars
mtcars['cyl']
unique(mtcars$cyl)
```

The mean of MPG is:
```{r The mean of mpg, echo=FALSE}
round(mean(mtcars$mpg), digits = 2) 

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
